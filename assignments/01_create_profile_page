# 🌟 Personal Profile Webpage Assignment

**Objective:**  
Create a single HTML page that introduces **you** — your name, photo, interests, school, and more — using HTML, a little CSS, and some JavaScript.

Then, go one step further: **put it online for the whole world to see!** 🌍

By the end, you’ll have:
- A cool personal webpage ✅
- A GitHub repo ✅
- A live website on the internet! 🔗

---

## ✅ Requirements

You will create **one file** called `profile.html`.  
This file will include HTML, internal CSS (in `<style>`), and a small JavaScript feature.

Then, you’ll upload it to **GitHub** and deploy it with **Netlify** — like a real web developer! 💻

---

## 🧱 Step 1: Start with a Basic HTML Template

Use this starter template. Copy and paste it into your `profile.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
  <title>My Profile</title>
  <style>
    /* You'll add CSS styles here later */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

> 💡 Save this file on your computer. Open it in a web browser (double-click it) to see your progress!

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Add Page Structure

Inside the `<body>`, create these **sections** using appropriate HTML tags:

1. `<header>` – Contains your name and a main heading  
2. `<section>` – About Me  
3. `<section>` – My Photo  
4. `<section>` – Interests & Hobbies  
5. `<section>` – Education  
6. `<section>` – Links (like GitHub)  
7. `<footer>` – A friendly closing message  

Each section should have a clear **heading** (`<h2>` or `<h3>`).

---

## 🧑‍💼 Step 3: Add Your Information

Fill in each section with **your real information**:

### 1. Header
- Use `<h1>` for your full name  
- Example: `<h1>Ali Khan</h1>`

### 2. About Me
- Write 2–3 sentences about yourself  
- Use a `<p>` tag  
- Example:  
  `<p>I'm 13 years old and I love coding, video games, and building robots...</p>`

### 3. My Photo
- Add a photo using `<img src="me.jpg" alt="A photo of me" width="200">`  
- Make sure the image file (e.g., `me.jpg`) is in the same folder as `profile.html`  
- 🔍 Tip: Always use the `alt` attribute!

### 4. Interests & Hobbies
- Use an unordered list `<ul>`  
- Include at least 5 things  
- Example:
  ```html
  <ul>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Minecraft</li>
    <li>Rock Music</li>
  </ul>
  ```

### 5. Education
- List your previous and current school  
- Example:  
  `<p>Current School: Lincoln Middle School, Grade 8</p>`

### 6. Links
- Add a link to your **GitHub profile**  
- Example:  
  `<a href="https://github.com/yourusername" target="_blank">Visit my GitHub</a>`

### 7. Footer
- Add a `<footer>` with a fun message  
- Example:  
  `<footer>Made with ❤️ by Me!</footer>`

---

## 🎨 Step 4: Add Simple Styling (CSS)

Inside the `<style>` section in the `<head>`, add some basic CSS:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background-color: #f0f8ff;
  color: #333;
  padding: 20px;
  line-height: 1.6;
}

header, footer {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px 0;
}

img {
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 5px solid #0077cc;
}

section {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

a {
  color: #0077cc;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

> 🎨 Feel free to change colors, fonts, and spacing to match your style!

---

## ⚡ Step 5: Add a JavaScript Feature

Add this **before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<script>
  alert("Welcome to my profile page!");
</script>
```

This shows a pop-up when the page loads.

**Bonus Challenge:**  
Replace the alert with a button that shows a fun fact!

```html
<button onclick="showFact()">Click for a Fun Fact!</button>
<p id="fact"></p>

<script>
  function showFact() {
    document.getElementById("fact").innerHTML = "I can type 60 words per minute!";
  }
</script>
```

## 📁 File Organization Tips

- Save your file as: `profile.html`
- Put your photo in the same folder
- Name your photo simply: `me.jpg`, `myface.png`, etc.
- Avoid spaces in filenames — use `my_photo.jpg` instead of `my photo.jpg`

---

## 🚀 Final Touches

1. Make sure your page opens in the browser without errors  
2. Check that:
   - Your photo shows up ✅
   - The GitHub link works ✅
   - The styling looks good ✅
   - The JavaScript does something cool ✅
3. Show it to your family and take pride in your work! 🏆

# 🌈 Bonus Step 6: Put Your Website Online! 🌐

This is the **coolest part** — let’s put your website on the internet so anyone can visit it from their phone or computer!

You’ll do 3 things:
1. Create a **GitHub account** (if you don’t have one)
2. Upload your code to a **GitHub repository**
3. Deploy it live using **Netlify** (for free!)

---

### 🔹 Step 6.1: Create a GitHub Account

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Choose a username (like `ali-codes`)
4. Enter your email and password
5. Complete the steps to create your account

✅ Done! You now have a GitHub profile.

---

### 🔹 Step 6.2: Create a New Repository

A **repository** (or "repo") is like a folder in the cloud for your code.

1. After logging in, click the **"+"** icon in the top right
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it: `my-profile`
4. Choose **"Public"** (so others can see it)
5. Click **"Create repository"**

---

### 🔹 Step 6.3: Upload Your Files

Now, upload your `profile.html` (and your photo) to GitHub:

1. In your repo, click **"Add file" → "Upload files"**
2. Drag and drop:
   - `profile.html`
   - Your photo (e.g., `me.jpg`)
3. Click **"Commit changes"** at the bottom

✅ Your code is now on GitHub!

Your website code is live on the internet — but not viewable as a webpage yet. Let’s fix that!

---

### 🔹 Step 6.4: Deploy to Netlify (Free & Easy!)

We’ll use **Netlify** to turn your code into a real website URL like:  
👉 `https://ali-codes.netlify.app`

#### Step 1: Go to Netlify
Open this link: [https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)

#### Step 2: Drag and Drop!
- Open your project folder on your computer
- Select both `profile.html` and your image
- Drag them into the Netlify page
- Wait a few seconds…

🎉 **Boom!** Netlify builds your site and gives you a live link!

Example: `https://clever-squirrel-123.netlify.app`

> 🔗 You can click the link and share it with anyone!

---

### 🔹 Step 6.5: (Optional) Connect Netlify to GitHub

Want your site to update automatically when you make changes? Let’s connect GitHub!

1. Go to [https://app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"New site from Git"**
4. Choose **GitHub** → select your `my-profile` repo
5. Click **"Deploy site"**

Now, every time you update your code on GitHub, Netlify will automatically update your live site! 🔄

---

## 🏅 You Did It!

You’ve just:
- Built your first website 🛠️
- Learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 🧠
- Used GitHub like a pro 💼
- Deployed a live website 🌐

That’s something **real developers** do every day — and now **you’ve done it too**! 🎉

---

## 📎 Example Final File Structure

Your folder should look like this:
```
📁 my-profile-folder/
   ├── profile.html
   └── me.jpg
```

And your GitHub repo should have both files.

---

## 💬 Final Note

There’s no single right way to do this. Be creative, be you — and most importantly, **have fun!**

You're not just writing code…  
You're building your **digital self**. 🖥️✨

---

## 🎁 Share Your Work!

When you're done:
- Send your Netlify link to your family
- Post it in your school tech club (if you have one)
- Add it to your GitHub profile README
- Print your code and hang it on the wall 😄

---

Let me know when you're done — I’d love to visit your live website!

— *From your biggest fan (probably Dad)* 😊
